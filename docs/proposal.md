RTEMS UART Driver – GSoC 2025 Proposal
This repository is created as part of my Google Summer of Code 2025 application to the RTEMS organization. The project aims to implement a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) driver for a microcontroller (e.g., ATmega328p or 8051) in the RTEMS Real-Time Operating System.

📌 Project Goal
Implement and integrate a UART driver for a microcontroller into an RTEMS BSP (Board Support Package), enabling serial communication with features like:

Initialization of UART
Basic data transmission and reception
Interrupt-based handling
Testing and documentation
